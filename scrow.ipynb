    "1. `#!/bin/bash`: This is a shebang line, which specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script.\n",
    "2. `SCRIPT_NAME=\"my_script.sh\"`: This sets the name of the script as \"my_script.sh\".\n",
    "3. `main() { ... }`: This defines a function called `main` that contains the command or set of commands you want to execute in your script.\n",
    "4. Inside the `main()` function, you can add any shell commands you like.\n",
    "5. `exit $?`: After running the main function, this line returns the exit status of the script (i.e., 0 if it ran successfully and a non-zero value if an error occurred).\n",

    "To make your script executable, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Save your script to a file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `my_script.sh`).\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.\n",
    "3. Run the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "chmod +x my_script.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will add execute permissions to the script, allowing you to run it as a shell command.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To test your script, save the `my_script.sh` file in a location that is listed in your system's PATH environment variable (usually `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, or `/usr/local/bin`). Then, simply type `./my_script.sh` to execute it.\n",

    ">>> how to make an alias to it\n",
    "To create an alias for your script, you can use the following command in your shell configuration file (usually `~/.bashrc`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "alias myscript='./path/to/your/script/my_script.sh'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `path/to/your/script/my_script.sh` with the actual path to your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of what this alias does:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `alias`: This is a keyword used to define an alias, which is a shortcut for a longer command.\n",
    "* `myscript='':` : The name you want to use as the alias (in this case, `myscript`).\n",
    "* `./path/to/your/script/my_script.sh`: The actual command that the alias will execute. The dot (`.`) and forward slash (`/`) are used to specify the script's location.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save your changes, you can add these lines to your shell configuration file and then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo source /etc/bash.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you're using `zsh`, you would use `~/.zshrc` instead.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also define the alias directly in your terminal session by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "alias myscript='./path/to/your/script/my_script.sh'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that aliases are only available for the current shell session. If you want to make the alias persistent across all shell sessions, you should add it to your shell configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more advanced example using an alias with arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "alias myscript='./path/to/your/script/my_script.sh arg1 arg2'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would execute your script with two additional arguments (`arg1` and `arg2`)."
