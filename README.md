Concise Definition of a Sigma Male Personality

A Sigma Male is a self-reliant, introspective individual who thrives outside conventional social hierarchies, embodying strength, wisdom, and purpose. Guided by the principles of Memento Mori ("Remember you must die") and As Above, So Below (unity of the macrocosm and microcosm), he masters Kairos (seizing the opportune moment) and refines himself perpetually through a Kaizen mindset (continuous improvement).

Strives for harmony between personal growth and his contributions to society.



3. Mastery of the Moment (Kairos)

4. Relentless Growth (Kaizen Mindset)
